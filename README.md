Iâ€™ve recently developed an Alarm Clock Application using Python as part of my task at Pinnacle Labs. This project showcases my ability to create user-friendly applications with customizable features, including:

Setting alarms with specific times
Selecting alarm tones from any audio file
Snooze functionality to get a little extra rest
